 S1 Computational Analysis:
 This file contains : The R code, for R(>= 3.5) and for R (4.1) 
                      PDF file contains a set of documentation, R code, results and datasets to fully reproduce the analysis and results of the correspondent                             publication.This PDF contains following results subsections of the publication: “Network analysis identifies KRAS-specific master           
                      regulators,” “KRAS master regulators define three core regulatory processes,” and “MR regulatory processes show different survival and 
                      mutational load.”

 Technical issues :
 inide the code you will find the link to download the data . However in somes cases this way doesn't work. In this case it,s sould be necessary to downloand  
 manually the data.
